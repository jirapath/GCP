# Quiz: Hybrid ML systems

>A key principle behind Kubeflow is portability so that you can:
>>- Migrate your model from TensorFlow to PyTorch. </br>
>>- Convert your model from CUDA to XLA. </br>
>>✔️ Move your model from on-premises to Google Cloud.
---
>Which of the following determines the correct property of Tensorflow Lite? Select TWO correct answers.
>>✔️ Quantization </br>
>>✔️ Lower precision arithmetic </br>
>>- Increased code footprint </br>
>>- Higher precision arithmetic
---
>Which of these are reasons that you may not be able to perform machine learning solely on Google Cloud? Check all that apply.
>>✔️ You are tied to on-premises or multi-cloud infrastructure due to business reasons. </br>
>>✔️ You need to run inference on the edge. </br>
>>- TensorFlow is not supported on Google Cloud.
---
>To copy the input data into TensorFlow, which of the following syntaxes is correct?
>>✔️ inferenceInterface.feed(inputName, floatValues, 1, inputSize, inputSize, 3); </br>
>>- inferenceInterface.feed(inputName, floatValues, 1, inputSize, 3); </br>
>>- inferenceInterface.feed(floatValues, 1, inputSize, inputSize, 3); </br>
>>- inferenceInterface.feed(inputName, floatValues, inputSize; inputSize);
