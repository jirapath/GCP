If you find out that your code cell isn't executing, what is a good step to check?
❌ - You may have lost connection to your datalab instance, consider trying datalab connect [name] inside of Cloud Shell
✔️ - All of the above are good troubleshooting options

Which of these are best practices when working with Cloud AI Platform notebooks? Select all 2 correct answers.
❌ - It's ALWAYS better to build and visualize charts inside of Cloud AI Platform Notebooks instead of any other BI tool (Looker, Tableau, Data Studio)
❌ - Always assume your viewers have already created the necessary GCS buckets and BigQuery datasets so you don't need to re-create them
✔️ - You can query your datasets directly from within Cloud AI Platform Notebooks to BigQuery to show steps in your data analysis
✔️ - Begin your notebooks with markdown cells explaining the purpose and goal of the notebook
