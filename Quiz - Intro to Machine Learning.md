Quiz: Intro to Machine Learning
What does a sentiment score of -1.0 at a magnitude of 1.0 represent for te❌t that has been processed through the NLP API?
❌ - A weak but still positive sentiment
✔️ - A strongly negative sentiment
❌ - A weak but still negative sentiment
❌ - A strongly positive sentiment

True or False: Because of the learning nature of ML Models, you will spend very little time cleaning and processing your datasets
❌ - True
✔️ - False

When creating a dataset for use in ML training, which of the below are the best practices to keep in mind?
✔️- For faster iteration, consider training on just a sample of your dataset
❌ - The more data you can put into a training dataset the better. Consider skipping the evaluation dataset step and compare your training results directly against your testing dataset for faster training.
❌ - To ensure the validity of your training be sure to use a random sample of data. Try using RAND( ) or other randomized operator to ensure your training dataset is randomized each time.

What is a key input to a pre-trained ML model like the Translation API microservice? Select all 2 correct answers.
❌ - For pre-trained models, you need to provide your dataset of training e❌amples so the model learns how you want to use it
✔️ - You need to provide the model with e❌pected parameters like which languages you are translating to and from
❌ - You will need to provide the model with a data input -- for translation this is normally a block of te❌t

Machine learning can be best described as: Select all 3 correct answers.
✔️ - A potentially viable option if you need to perform predictive analysis like "What is my revenue going to be ne❌t quarter?"
✔️ - An iterative cycle of continual data research, model refinement, and insights through a learning feedback loop
✔️ - A method of replacing heuristic rules and hardcoded logic trees with learning models
❌ - Your first go-to option for any data analysis problem no matter how big or small
❌ - A way of getting around not having enough data -- the ML models will automatically learn and fill in the gaps in our training datasets
