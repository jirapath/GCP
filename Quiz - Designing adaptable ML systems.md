Which of the following tools help software users manage dependency issues?
Polylithic programs
Modular programs
Monolithic programs
Maven, Gradle, and Pip

What is training skew caused by?
Starting and stopping of the processing when training the model.
Your development and production environments are different, or different code is used in the training environment than in the development environment.
The Cloud Storage you load your data from in the training environment is physically closer than the Cloud Storage you load your data from in the production environment.
The prediction environment is slower than the training environment.

Suppose you are building an ML-based system to predict the likelihood that a customer will leave a positive review. The user interface that customers leave reviews on changed a few months ago, but you don't know about this. Which of these is a potential consequence of mismanaging this data dependency?
Change in model serving signature
Change in ability of model to be part of a streaming ingest
Losses in prediction quality

Which of the following models are susceptible to a feedback loop? Check all that apply.
A housing-value model that predicts house prices, using size (area in square meters), number of bedrooms, and geographic location as features.
A university-ranking model that rates schools in part by their selectivity (the percentage of students who applied that were admitted).
A face-attributes model that detects whether a person is smiling in a photo, which is regularly trained on a database of stock photography that is automatically updated monthly.
An election-results model that forecasts the winner of a mayoral race by surveying 2% of voters after the polls have closed.
A traffic-forecasting model that predicts congestion at highway exits near the beach, using beach crowd size as one of its features.
A book-recommendation model that suggests novels its users may like based on their popularity (i.e., the number of times the books have been purchased).

Gradual drift is used for which of the following?
An old concept that incrementally changes to a new concept over a period of time
An old concept that may reoccur after some time
A new concept that rapidly replaces an old one over a short period of time
A new concept that occurs within a short time

What is the shift in the actual relationship between the model inputs and the output called?
Label drift
Data drift
Prediction drift
Concept drift

Which component identifies anomalies in training and serving data and can automatically create a schema by examining the data?
Data transform
Data identifier
Data ingestion
Data validation
