Select the statements below that are an accurate description of machine learning: Select all 3 correct answers.
✔️ - A potentially viable option if you need to perform predictive analysis like "What is my revenue going to be next quarter?"
✔️ - An iterative cycle of continual data research, model refinement, and insights through a learning feedback loop
✔️ - A method of replacing heuristic rules and hardcoded logic trees with learning models
Your first go-to option for any data analysis problem no matter how big or small
A way of getting around not having enough data -- the ML models will automatically learn and fill in the gaps in our training datasets

When creating a dataset for use in ML training, which of the below are the best practices to keep in mind?
The more data you can put into a training dataset the better. Consider skipping the evaluation dataset step and compare your training results directly against your testing dataset for faster training.
To ensure the validity of your training be sure to use a random sample of data. Try using RAND( ) or other randomized operator to ensure your training dataset is randomized each time.
✔️ - For faster iteration, consider training on just a sample of your dataset

True or False: Because of the learning nature of ML Models, you will spend very little time cleaning and processing your datasets
✔️ - False
True

What does a sentiment score of -1.0 at a magnitude of 1.0 represent for text that has been processed through the NLP API?
A weak but still negative sentiment
✔️ - A strongly negative sentiment
A strongly positive sentiment
A weak but still positive sentiment

What is a key input to a pre-trained ML model like the Translation API microservice? Select all 2 correct answers.
✔️ - You need to provide the model with expected parameters like which languages you are translating to and from
For pre-trained models, you need to provide your dataset of training examples so the model learns how you want to use it
✔️ - You will need to provide the model with a data input -- for translation this is normally a block of text
