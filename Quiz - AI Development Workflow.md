#AI Development Workflow ---------
Which stage of the machine learning workflow includes model training and evaluation?
Model serving
✔️ - Model development
Data preparation

A hospital uses the machine learning technology of Google to help pre-diagnose cancer by feeding historical patient medical data to the model. The goal is to identify as many potential cases as possible. Which metric should the model focus on?
Feature importance
✔️ - Recall
Precision
Confusion matrix

A farm uses the machine learning technology of Google to detect defective apples in their crop, like those with irregular sizes or scratches. The goal is to identify only the apples that are actually bad so that no good apples are wasted. Which metric should the model focus on?
